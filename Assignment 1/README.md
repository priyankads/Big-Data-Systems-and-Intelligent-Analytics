# Data Ingestion and Visualization using GCP

[Live GitHub Page](https://priyankads.github.io/Big-Data-Systems-and-Intelligent-Analytics/Assignment%201/) :rocket:

### Understanding the SEVIR dataset

Asking the following questions -

1. Where is the data?
2. What is the data about?
3. How do we plan to access it?

### Understanding the data visualization

Asking the following questions - 

1. What were the longest occurring events in the data?
2. What was the Age-to-Sex distribution for all events in the data?
3. What were the most occurring event types in the data?
4. What was the Geo-Location distribution of Indirect and Direct injuries in the data?

------------
### Requirements to use the cookiecutter template:
-----------
 - Python 2.7 or 3.5+
 - [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages:

``` bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

or

``` bash
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda install cookiecutter
```

### To start a new project, run:
------------

``` bash
    cookiecutter -c v1 https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science
```
